# Quest Mod Templater

**Not everything is perfect and my C# is a bit shit, so feel free to let me know if there are any issues with the programme or if you would like to contribute to the project just create a new PR.**

This programme clones/fetches [Laurie The Fish's quest-mod-template](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template) and creates a template for your Quest Mod using it.

## Installation
Download the Zip and extract to a secure location (e.g. Program Files or AppData/Roaming)
Add the directory path of where you just unzipped the programme to your `PATH` environment variable
(You may need to restart your computer for changes to take affect)

## Usage
- To create a new mod from the template, run `qmt create`
- To update the template and pull a new version from Laurie's repo, run `qmt update`
- To clear the cloned template, run `qmt clear`
- And to view a list of command run `qmt help`
